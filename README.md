# Help-Sustantability-in-Mexico
Water for Everyone | Documentary: Chiapas, Mexico This effort, which took two years to mature and finish, aims to create critical thinking about the dysfunctional society in which we live and does not have access to the information necessary to stay and make a safe place for our children and grandchildren. Social dysfunction is the most serious problem we face as citizens, a serious social crisis caused by many generations without access to scientific, ethical and sustainable education. Direction: Gerardo Gonz√°lez Miranda NOTE: This work is designed to reach more than 5 million people, to exert pressure and public opinion, for this I can ask for financial contributions, to achieve it.
